# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project uses **Machine Learning models** to predict whether a patient is **Diabetic** or **Non-Diabetic**.  
It includes:  
- Data preprocessing  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- Model evaluation  
- A **Prediction Engine** that takes new patient data and returns an instant prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- Dataset: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age  
- Target: **Outcome** (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

## ðŸ“Š Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Accuracy and metrics are displayed for each model.

- The best model can be used for real-world predictions.
